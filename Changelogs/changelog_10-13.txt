Refactored code to be compatible with pyinstaller
    1. Instead of using path.join() A new function was added at the head of Main.py called resource_path()
    2. The application must get the current working directory and combine with the resource path to point to the
        correct file in the output directory

Steps to run and configure pyinstaller
    1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe
    2. Update pip and all libraries (reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15221473/how-do-i-update-pip-itself-from-inside-my-virtual-environment)
    3. Run auto-py-to-exe's run.py
    4. Select Main.py (or whatever the main code name is if we change it) as the script location
    5. Select "One Directory"
    6. Select "Window Based"
    7. Select Icon (if applicable)
    8. Add Folder for all resource folders, name the folder the same as it is in the code
    9. Click Convert .PY to .EXE

    If issues arise, export as a console based and run the program from the command prompt. Follow up with any
    TraceBacks to fix the issue.

    If the code doesn't export successfully as .exe, the best I have found is to search the error on google and do your
    best to troubleshoot.
